The probability of landing 10 heads back to back with independent coin tosses is: $$\frac{1}{2^{10}}$$. It is important to note that in reality, even a fair coin might not have an equal distribution of flips when flipped for a small number of times. However, because of law of large numbers, it does converge to the true probability (which is $$1/2$$) when tossed for a large number of times.  Now, the threshold for suspicion is different for every person. However, it is already one in a ~1000 chance to land 10 consecutive heads. So a person might decide to flip the coin more times, calculate the joint probability of all these independent events and make a decision on their own when to be suspicious based on the probability for that event to occur (i.e. the event when all the flips lands a head).
